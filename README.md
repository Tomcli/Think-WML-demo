# Zero to Singularity: Create, Tune, Deploy and Scale a Deep Neural Network in 90 Minutes

## Instructions

### Set up Watson Studio Environment

1. [Sign in](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) or [Register an account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) on IBM Cloud.

2. Once you login to IBM Cloud, go to catalog and create the following lite services.

- [Watson Studio](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-studio)
- [Cloud Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloud-object-storage)
- [Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/machine-learning)

3. Go to the [Resource List](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) using the navigation menu at the top left hand corner. Select the Watson Studio service, and click on **Get Started**. This will pop up a new browser tap that redirect you to the Watson Studio page.

4. Now let's create a project that can store everything you will be doing in this tutorial. Click on **Create a project**, and choose the **Deep Learning** project starter. Then you can bind the **Cloud Object Storage** and **Machine Learning** services to this project.

5. Once you entered to your project, you can select the **Environment** tap at the top and pick **Default Python 3.5 Free** for your Environment Runtime. Then click on **New notebook** at the right.

  Then select the **From URL tap**, and paste our demo notebook link below under the **Notebook URL** section.
